This is a game heavily inspired by "Darkest Dungeon", a game by Red Hook studios and the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. video game series by GSC Game World. 
It includes a splash screen, a shop, and a game map with 4 levels.

In this project, the pygame library is used to implement user input, GUI, art, animations, and sounds.
